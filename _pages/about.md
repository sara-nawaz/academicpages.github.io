Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Institute for Science, Innovation and Society](https://www.insis.ox.ac.uk) at the University of Oxford, where I am researching the governance of marine carbon dioxide removal/negative emissions technologies as part of the project [OceanNETs](https://www.oceannets.eu/). Broadly, my work uses a range of quantitative and qualitative methods to explore the wide-ranging social, political, and ethical dilemmas that arise with the development of new climate and environmental technologies.  

I completed my PhD at the [Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability](https://www.ires.ubc.ca) at the University of British Columbia in August 2021, where my research focused on gene editing and synthetic biology in agriculture. I am still affiliated with the University of British Columbia and contribute to the project [Solid Carbon](https://solidcarbon.ca/).

Prior to completing my PhD, I worked as a consultant at Environmental Resources Management and as a researcher at the World Resources Institute. I also hold an MPhil from Oxford University and a BA from Swarthmore College. I am an avid rock climber.
