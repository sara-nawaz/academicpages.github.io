Welcome! I am an environmental social scientist who researches the social dimensions of emerging climate and environmental technologies, particularly carbon dioxide removal (CDR). I am currently the Director of Research at American University's [Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy](https://www.american.edu/sis/centers/carbon-removal/), and also affiliated with the [Institute for Science, Innovation and Society](https://www.insis.ox.ac.uk) at the University of Oxford, and the [Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability](https://www.ires.ubc.ca) at the University of British Columbia. I use a range of qualitative and quantitative methods to engage societal actors (e.g., local communities, Indigenous communities, experts, the general public) on the assessment and governance of CDR, ranging from direct air capture to ocean alkalinity enhancement. I am part of several research projects exploring the feasibility of CDR approaches, namely [OceanNETs](https://www.oceannets.eu/) and [Solid Carbon](https://solidcarbon.ca/). 

My work is motivated by a fascination with both the 'natural' world and the human ingenuity of engineered technologies; a sense of commitment to principles of justice, both in contexts of settler-colonial North America and across the Global North-South divide; and a curiosity about the sticky tradeoffs often involved with decisionmaking in the context of climate change.  

I conducted postdoctoral work at the University of Oxford and completed my PhD at the University of British Columbia, where my research focused on gene editing and synthetic biology in agriculture. You can read a summary of my PhD thesis research [here](https://sara-nawaz.github.io/files/Nawaz%20thesis%20summary.pdf). Before my PhD, I worked as a consultant at Environmental Resources Management and as a researcher at the World Resources Institute. I also have an MPhil from Oxford University in Development Studies and a BA from Swarthmore College in economics. 

I am queer, second-generation Bengali and white, and an avid rock climber. I currently live on unceded Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish) territory.
