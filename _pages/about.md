Welcome! I recently completed my PhD at the [Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability](https://www.ires.ubc.ca) at the University of British Columbia, and will be starting Fall 2021 as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Institute for Science, Innovation and Society](https://www.insis.ox.ac.uk) at the University of Oxford, as well as at the [Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions](https://pics.uvic.ca). 

I am interested in how to navigate the wide-ranging social, political, and ethical dilemmas that arise with the development of new climate and environmental technologies. My postdoctoral work examines the implications of negative emissions technologies (NETs) in marine spaces, with focus on two pilot projects around marine NETs: [OceanNETs](https://www.oceannets.eu/) and [Solid Carbon](https://pics.uvic.ca/projects/solid-carbon-negative-emissions-technology-feasibility-study). My PhD research focused on gene editing and syntehtic biology in agriculture. I draw upon a mix of quantitative and qualitative approaches, ranging from surveys to ethnographic methods.

I ask questions like: How do people evaluate the complex **value-based tradeoffs** that these technologies often involve? How do assumptions about **what is 'nature' or 'natural'** underpin policy around genetic engineering, and how has the rise of genomics and **synthetic biology** challenged those assumptions? Are genomic **data 'physical' or 'informational'**, and how does the answer matter for biodiversity policy? Can we measure the extent to which broad, **system-level critiques**, such as around the necessity of technologies, correspond to people's thinking around novel technologies? Where do people 'draw a line' between acceptable and unacceptable levels of modification of the environment, and why? With my research, I aim to help shift technological innovation and governance to be more just, equitable, and effective.

Prior to my PhD, I worked as a consultant at Environmental Resources Management and as a researcher at the World Resources Institute. 
In my free time, I enjoy all types of rock climbing, which is easy to access where I currently live in Squamish, British Columbia.
