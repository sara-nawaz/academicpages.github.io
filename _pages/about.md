Welcome! I am an environmental social scientist who researches the social impacts and governance of emerging climate and environmental technologies, particularly [carbon](https://www.american.edu/sis/centers/carbon-removal/what-it-is.cfm) [removal](https://cdrprimer.org/). I am currently the Director of Research at American University's [Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy](https://www.american.edu/sis/centers/carbon-removal/). I am also an Adjunct Professor at the [Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability](https://www.ires.ubc.ca) at the University of British Columbia and a Research Affiliate at the [Institute for Science, Innovation and Society](https://www.insis.ox.ac.uk) at the University of Oxford. 

In much of my work, I collaborate with societal actors (e.g., local communities, Indigenous communities, natural scientists, the general public) on the assessment and governance of carbon removal technologies, particularly approaches like direct air capture and novel ocean-based methods. Currently, I am involved in several projects that aim to understand societal perceptions of ocean alkalinity enhancement and governance conditions for its responsible research and deployment (funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ClimateWorks Foundation, the British Columbia Center for Innovation and Clean Energy, and the Department of Energy). I have been part of research projects exploring the feasibility of carbon removal approaches, namely [OceanNETs](https://www.oceannets.eu/) and [Solid Carbon](https://solidcarbon.ca/). I am also on the science advisory board for the [Carbon-to-Sea Initiative](https://carbontosea.org/) and have served as a governance reviewer for [Frontier Climate](https://frontierclimate.com/).

My research sits at the intersection of science and technology studies, perceived risk, and decision sciences. I am particularly interested in understanding how political economic contexts and conditions shape judgment on novel technologies like carbon removal. I make use of a range of qualitative and quantitative methods, such as interviews, surveys, deliberative workshops, and hybrid approaches like Q method. My work is motivated by a fascination with both the 'natural' world and engineered technologies; a commitment to principles of justice, both in contexts of settler-colonial North America and across the Global North-South divide; and a curiosity about the tradeoffs often involved with decisionmaking in the context of climate change. 

I conducted postdoctoral work at the University of Oxford and completed my PhD at the University of British Columbia, where my research was on social dimensions of novel biotechnology (primarily gene editing) in agriculture. You can read a summary of my PhD thesis research [here](https://sara-nawaz.github.io/files/Nawaz%20thesis%20summary.pdf). Before my PhD, I worked as a consultant at Environmental Resources Management and as a researcher at the World Resources Institute. I also have an MPhil from the University of Oxford in Development Studies and a BA from Swarthmore College in economics. 

For some other information on me: I'm a queer, second-generation Bengali-American of mixed ancestry. I'm also an avid rock climber. I live on unceded Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish) and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) territory.
