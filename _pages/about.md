Welcome! I am an environmental social scientist who researches the social impacts and governance of emerging climate and environmental technologies, particularly [carbon](https://www.american.edu/sis/centers/carbon-removal/what-it-is.cfm) [removal](https://cdrprimer.org/). I am currently the Director of Research at American University's [Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy](https://www.american.edu/sis/centers/carbon-removal/), and also affiliated with the [Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability](https://www.ires.ubc.ca) at the University of British Columbia and the [Institute for Science, Innovation and Society](https://www.insis.ox.ac.uk) at the University of Oxford. 

I am currently involved in several projects (funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ClimateWorks Foundation, the British Columbia Center for Innovation and Clean Energy, and the Department of Energy) that aim to understand public perceptions of ocean alkalinity enhancement and governance conditions for its responsible research and deployment. I have been part of several research projects exploring the feasibility of carbon removal approaches, namely [OceanNETs](https://www.oceannets.eu/) and [Solid Carbon](https://solidcarbon.ca/). I am on the science advisory board for the [Carbon-to-Sea Initiative](https://carbontosea.org/) and I have also served as a governance reviewer for [Frontier Climate](https://frontierclimate.com/).

In my work, I aim to collaborate with societal actors (e.g., local communities, Indigenous communities, experts, the general public) on the assessment and governance of novel carbon removal technologies, ranging from direct air capture to ocean alkalinity enhancement. My research sits at the intersection of science and technology studies, perceived risk, and decision sciences. I make use of a range of qualitative and quantitative methods, such as semi-structured interviews, surveys, deliberative workshops, and hybrid quantitative-qualitative approaches like Q method. My work is motivated by a fascination with both the 'natural' world and engineered technologies; a commitment to principles of justice, both in contexts of settler-colonial North America and across the Global North-South divide; and a curiosity about the sticky tradeoffs often involved with decisionmaking in the context of climate change. 

I conducted postdoctoral work at the University of Oxford and completed my PhD at the University of British Columbia, where my research was on social dimensions of gene editing in agriculture. You can read a summary of my PhD thesis research [here](https://sara-nawaz.github.io/files/Nawaz%20thesis%20summary.pdf). Before my PhD, I worked as a consultant at Environmental Resources Management and as a researcher at the World Resources Institute. I also have an MPhil from Oxford University in Development Studies and a BA from Swarthmore College in economics. 

For some other information on me: I'm a queer, second-generation Bengali-American of mixed ancestry. I'm also an avid rock climber. I currently live on unceded Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish) territory.
