Welcome! I am an environmental social scientist who researches the social, ethical and justice implications of emerging climate and environmental technologies, particularly carbon dioxide removal (CDR). I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Institute for Science, Innovation and Society](https://www.insis.ox.ac.uk) at the University of Oxford, as well as at the [Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability](https://www.ires.ubc.ca) at the University of British Columbia. I use a range of qualitative and quantitative methods to engage societal actors (e.g., local communities, Indigenous communities, experts, the general public) on the assessment and governance of CDR, ranging from direct air capture to ocean alkalinity enhancement. I am part of several research projets exploring the feasibility of CDR approaches, namely [OceanNETs](https://www.oceannets.eu/) as well as [Solid Carbon](https://solidcarbon.ca/). I am also serving as an expert reviewer for Frontier/Stripe Climate's latest round of CDR purchasing applications. 

I completed my PhD at the University of British Columbia, where my research focused on gene editing and synthetic biology in agriculture. You can read a summary of my thesis research [here](https://sara-nawaz.github.io/files/Nawaz%20thesis%20summary.pdf).

Prior to completing my PhD, I worked as a consultant at Environmental Resources Management and as a researcher at the World Resources Institute. I also hold an MPhil from Oxford University in Development Studies and a BA from Swarthmore College in economics. I am an avid rock climber. 

I currently live on unceded Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish) territory.
